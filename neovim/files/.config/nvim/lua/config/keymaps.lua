-- keymaps.lua, since that one is registered outside this file. Settled on
-- <leader>ac ("autocomplete") instead - nothing else is bound under

-- Searchable cheatsheet - see lua/cheatsheet.lua for the implementation.

-- Key history, so this doesn't get relitigated: bare `?` is native
-- backward-search and stays. `<leader>?` looks free in a headless probe but
-- is claimed by LazyVim (editor.lua, "Buffer Keymaps") - it's a lazy `keys`
-- spec, so the mapping only materialises once which-key loads. `g?` worked
-- fine but was swapped out on request. `??` also works but makes `?` a
-- mapping prefix. `<leader>h` is genuinely unclaimed: no custom mapping, no
-- sub-mappings under it, and no native command lost. Only LazyVim's
-- harpoon2 extra wants `<leader>h`, and that extra isn't enabled here - if
-- it ever is, this is the one that would need moving.

-- backspace, which plain <BS> already does. A terminal that sends ^? for it
-- is indistinguishable from <BS> and needs fixing on the terminal side.
