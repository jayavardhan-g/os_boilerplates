# Purpose of this folder

This is Jayavardhan's changelog/runbook for system/config decisions on his machine —
not limited to any one distro or tool. It's split by scope:

- **`cachyos/`** — anything specific to *this* **CachyOS + Hyprland** setup: Hyprland
  binds/layouts/workspaces, input device quirks, and any fix that only exists because of
  Hyprland or this distro's packaging (AUR, pacman-specific choices tied to a CachyOS/Arch
  decision). Most of what gets recorded here touches files outside this repo (mainly
  `~/.config/hypr/`, but not only that). Wouldn't apply if the window manager or distro
  changed.
- **Every other top-level folder is one portable tool** (`vim/`, `neovim/`, `ssh/`,
  `vpn/`, `spotify/`, etc.) — a real dotfile or setup decision that would work
  identically on any Linux box (or macOS, for some) regardless of window manager or
  distro. One folder per tool, not a shared "global" catch-all.

See root `README.md` for the current folder map — keep it in sync with this rule whenever
a top-level folder is added or removed.

This folder itself holds no code to run. It's a durable record so that:
- Jayavardhan can look back and remember *why* a setting is the way it is.
- If he reinstalls or sets up a new machine, he can replay some or all of these changes instead of starting from scratch.
- The whole thing can be committed to git as a personal dotfiles/decisions log.

**Don't commit `.claude/`** — it holds session-local Claude Code settings (e.g. `settings.local.json`, a permission allowlist), not part of this record. Keep a `.gitignore` at the repo root with `.claude/` in it.

## What you (Claude) must do in this repo

**1. Before making changes**, skim root `README.md` to find the right home — `cachyos/README.md` (for a Hyprland/CachyOS-specific change) or the relevant tool folder — then skim that index/folder. If today's task modifies or extends something already recorded there, update that existing entry rather than writing a near-duplicate.

**2. Whenever a session makes an actual system/config change** — edits a dotfile, changes a setting via `hyprctl`/similar that the user wants kept, installs a package, or makes any other decision the user would want to reproduce later — record it before the conversation ends. Ephemeral diagnostics (`hyprctl getoption` to check a value, one-off `ls`/`grep` to investigate) are NOT recorded — only the actual persisted decision/change.

**Classify every change before writing it down** — this is the part most likely to get skipped:
- Ask: *would this exact problem and fix exist on a different window manager or distro?*
  If yes, it's portable → goes in that tool's own folder. If the problem or fix only
  exists **because** this machine runs Hyprland/CachyOS specifically (e.g. a keyring
  daemon that needs manual starting because Chromium's desktop-environment detection
  doesn't recognize Hyprland, or an AUR package chosen for Arch-specific packaging
  reasons), it's CachyOS-specific → goes in `cachyos/`, even if the tool itself
  (VSCode, say) is cross-platform.
- Don't classify by "does this command happen to be pacman/AUR" — plenty of portable-tool
  entries reference pacman just because that's this machine's package manager (e.g.
  installing `python-lsp-server`). The test is whether the underlying *problem and fix*
  are Hyprland/CachyOS-caused, not what package manager the install line happens to use.
- **If a single change has both parts** (e.g. installing a cross-platform tool, but also
  wiring it into Hyprland's autostart/keybinds/window rules), split it: document the
  portable setup in the tool's own folder, and document only the Hyprland-specific wiring
  in `cachyos/` (usually `cachyos/system/` or `window-management/`) — cross-link the two
  with `[[name]]` rather than duplicating content. Don't split further than that: if the
  portable part is too thin to stand as its own entry (no real reusable artifact, just a
  one-line reason embedded in a Hyprland-caused fix), keep the whole thing in `cachyos/`
  instead of creating a near-empty tool folder for it.

**Never record secrets.** This folder is meant for git, possibly a remote/shared one. Never write usernames, passwords, API keys/tokens, Wi-Fi credentials, private IPs/hostnames tied to a specific person, license keys, or any other credential into an entry — not even inside a config snippet. If a change necessarily involves one (e.g. setting up a login for some service), describe the step in words ("prompted for the account password during setup") and use a placeholder like `<password>` in any snippet, never the real value. If you're about to paste a command or config block into an entry, scan it for anything that looks like a secret first.

**3. File location and naming**:

For a **CachyOS/Hyprland-specific** change, create/update a file at:
```
cachyos/<category>/<kebab-case-slug>.md
```
Categories in use so far (add a new one if nothing fits — update this list when you do):
- `input/` — keyboard, mouse, touchpad, scroll behavior
- `keybindings/` — Hyprland binds, submaps, dispatchers
- `window-management/` — layouts, tiling behavior, workspaces
- `appearance/` — theming, decorations, colors
- `system/` — packages, services, anything outside `~/.config/hypr` that's still
  Hyprland/CachyOS-caused

For a **portable tool config**, create/update a file at:
```
<tool>/<kebab-case-slug>.md
```
at the repo root — no category subfolders needed here, since each tool folder is usually
small (often just one file). Use an existing tool folder if one already exists for that
tool (check root `README.md`); create a new one if nothing fits — a tool folder is
warranted once there's a real portable artifact to document (a dotfile, a plugin config),
not for a single passing mention.

**4. Entry template** — use this structure for every file:

```markdown
# <Short title>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Category:** <input|keybindings|window-management|appearance|system> (cachyos/ entries) or the tool name (portable entries, e.g. `vim`, `neovim`)
**Files touched:** `~/.config/hypr/config/whatever.lua` (or other paths)

## What
One or two sentences: what changed, in plain terms.

## Why
The actual reasoning/motivation — what problem this solved or what the user asked for.

## Change
The exact, copy-pasteable snippet(s) or commands needed to reproduce this from a fresh
config. Prefer showing the final state of the relevant block over a diff, so it can be
pasted directly into a fresh setup.

## Notes
Gotchas, conflicts with other binds/settings, things that didn't work and why, or
follow-up decisions that superseded this one (link to that file instead of duplicating).
```

**5. After writing/updating entries**, keep the indexes in sync:
- A `cachyos/`-specific entry: update `cachyos/README.md`'s index table (one row per
  entry file: title, category, one-line summary, path). Keep it sorted by category, then
  roughly chronological within category.
- A portable-tool entry: update root `README.md`'s folder table if this created a new
  top-level tool folder, or its linked file if the folder already existed and just needs
  a different file linked. These folders are small enough not to need their own
  per-folder README/index table the way `cachyos/` does.

**6. Superseded decisions**: if a later session changes something already recorded (e.g. a keybind gets moved again), update the existing entry's `Change` section to the new final state, and add a line under `Notes` describing what it used to be and why it changed, rather than leaving stale/contradictory info across two files.

Keep entries factual and terse — this is a reference for reproducing setup, not a narrative. No need to record failed experiments unless the failure itself is the useful lesson (e.g. "X doesn't work because Y" is worth keeping so it isn't retried).

See the `better-os-question` skill for how to answer "is there a better OS than this?" if Jayavardhan asks.
