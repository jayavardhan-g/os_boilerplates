# Obsidian vim mode matching the nvim/LazyVim keymaps

**Date:** 2026-10-02
**Category:** obsidian
**Files touched:** `~/notes/.obsidian/.obsidian.vimrc`, `~/notes/.obsidian/hotkeys.json`,
`~/notes/.obsidian/community-plugins.json`, `~/notes/.obsidian/plugins/mrj-jump-to-link/`
(stored copies under `obsidian/files/notes/.obsidian/`)

## What
Obsidian's vim mode (vault `~/notes`) remapped so the same keys do the same thing as in
`~/.config/nvim` (see [[keybindings-and-editing]]), via the Vimrc Support plugin's
`.obsidian.vimrc`. Added the Jump to link plugin as the stand-in for flash.nvim.

## Why
Wanted Obsidian to feel like nvim. The vimrc from 2026-09-20 had drifted to browser/VSCode
keys and Obsidian-only choices (H/L = ^/$, surround on `s`, Alt+hjkl focus) that did
something different in nvim.

## Change
Prereqs (vault-local, travel with the `~/notes` git repo):
- Settings → Editor → Vim key bindings on (`"vimMode": true` in `app.json`).
- Community plugins: **Vimrc Support** (`obsidian-vimrc-support`, 0.10.2), **Omnisearch**,
  **Git** (`obsidian-git`), **Jump to link** (`mrj-jump-to-link`, 0.6.1 — installed from
  the GitHub release: `gh release download 0.6.1 -R mrjackphil/obsidian-jump-to-link`
  into `.obsidian/plugins/mrj-jump-to-link/`, then added to `community-plugins.json`).
- Default hotkeys cleared in `hotkeys.json` because Obsidian hotkeys fire *before*
  vimrc maps: Ctrl+O (quick switcher), Ctrl+I/B (italic/bold), Ctrl+H (search & replace),
  Ctrl+K (insert link), Ctrl+L (toggle checklist), Ctrl+D (delete paragraph — otherwise
  Ctrl+D deletes text instead of scrolling).

Key map (nvim key → Obsidian action):

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `<Space><Space>`, `<Space>ff`, `<Space>fr` | quick switcher |
| `<Space>/`, `<Space>sg` / `<Space>sb` | Omnisearch vault / this note |
| `<Space>e` / `<Space>E` | toggle left sidebar (explorer) / right sidebar (backlinks, outline, tags, git) |
| `<Space>bd`, `<Space>wd` / `<Space>bo` | close tab / close others |
| `<Space>fn`, `<Space>fN`, `<Space>cr`, `<Space>ul` | new note, new folder, rename note, toggle line numbers |
| `<Space>fe`, `<Space>fd` | reveal note in explorer, delete note (Obsidian confirms) |
| `<Space>m` | move note to another folder (restored from the original leader block) |
| `<Space>bp`, `<Space>bu`, `<Space>ba` | pin tab, reopen closed tab, bookmark note |
| `<Space>um` | toggle reading view / live preview |
| `<Space>x`, `<Space>>` | tick checkbox, toggle blockquote (line or selection) |
| `<Space>od`, `[d` / `]d` | today's daily note, prev / next daily note |
| `<Space>ob` (also `gr`), `<Space>oB` | backlinks sidebar, backlinks at bottom of note |
| `<Space>oo` (also `gO`, `<Space>cs`), `<Space>ot` | outline, tags |
| `<Space>og` / `<Space>oG` | graph / local graph |
| `<Space>oi`, `<Space>oM` | insert template, bookmarks list |
| `<Space>op` / `<Space>oP` | fold frontmatter / open properties panel |
| `<Space>gg`, `<Space>gb`, `]h` / `[h` | obsidian-git view, blame, next/prev hunk |
| `<Space>gl`, `<Space>gd`, `<Space>gc` | git history view, diff view, commit-and-sync (commit + pull + push) |
| `gf`, `go`, `gD` | follow link, open link in new tab, open link in split |
| `za`, `zm` / `zr` | toggle fold, fold more / less |
| `<C-d>` / `<C-u>`, `n` / `N` | half-page scroll / search jump, kept centered (`zz`) |
| `:q`, `:wq`, `:vs`, `:sp` | close tab, close tab, split right, split below |
| `<Space>y` / `<Space>Y`, `<Space>-` / `<Space>\|` | `"+y` / `"+y$`, split below / right |
| `H` / `L`, `[b` / `]b`, `gt` / `gT` | prev / next tab |
| `<C-h/j/k/l>` | focus pane left/down/up/right |
| `<A-j>` / `<A-k>` | move line down / up |
| `gd`, `gx` | follow link under cursor |
| `s` | Lightspeed jump (type 2 chars, then label) — flash stand-in |
| `gsa"` `gsa'` ``gsa` `` `gsa(` `gsa[` `gsa{` `gsam` `gsai` `gsab` `gsaw` | surround with quotes/brackets/`$`/`*`/`**`/`[[ ]]` |
| `<Esc>` | clear search highlight |
| `x` | `"_x` |

Kept from before: Ctrl+T/W/Tab/Shift+Tab, Ctrl+P / Ctrl+Shift+P, Ctrl+B / Ctrl+Shift+B,
Ctrl+Shift+F, Ctrl+Shift+M, Ctrl+O/I history, zo/zc/zR/zM folds, Alt+P paste-as-link,
`set clipboard=unnamed`. Full file: `obsidian/files/notes/.obsidian/.obsidian.vimrc`.

## Notes
- `set clipboard=unnamed` stays: nvim locally uses LazyVim's `clipboard=unnamedplus`, so
  plain `y` hits the system clipboard there too. In this engine `"+y`/`"+p` call
  `navigator.clipboard` directly, and `"_` is a real black hole register (checked in
  `/usr/lib/obsidian/obsidian.asar` → `lib/codemirror/vim.js`).
- A multi-key map can't share its first key with a built-in single-key command. The
  dispatcher fires the full match first, which is why `unmap <Space>` / `nunmap s` come
  before the sequences.
- Surround is add-only (the plugin's `surround` ex command), so there's no `gsd`/`gsr`.
  `gsa…` wraps the selection, or the word under the cursor; it doesn't take a motion
  like mini.surround.
- `s` is normal-mode only; visual `s` is native substitute. No `S` (flash treesitter)
  equivalent.
- Lost with the cleared hotkeys: Ctrl+L checklist toggle and Ctrl+K insert link (use
  `gsaw`, or the command palette). Search & replace is still in the palette, and `:s` works.
- Superseded: the 2026-09-20 layout had H/L = `^`/`$`, Alt+hjkl pane focus, `,` = `:nohl`,
  surround on `s"`/`sb`/`sw`…, and a truncated `map <A-p> :pasteinto` with no `<CR>` (fixed).
- Splits are on the leader only (`<Space>|` / `<Space>-`). Ctrl+- / Ctrl+| hotkeys were
  briefly added on 2026-10-02 and then dropped at the user's request, which also kept
  Ctrl+- as zoom-out. If they're ever wanted: Ctrl+- overrides zoom-out (an app-menu
  accelerator; a matched Obsidian hotkey calls `preventDefault`), and Ctrl+| has to go in
  `hotkeys.json` as `Mod+Shift` + `\`. A vimrc map can't express it.
- Original bindings, for reference. The user's pre-2026-09-20 vimrc leader block:
  `<Space>h/l` sidebars, `<Space>m` move file, `<Space>q` close, `<Space>z` zen
  (plugin not installed), `<Space>/` search, `<Space>|`/`<Space>-` splits. Older
  `hotkeys.json` (removed in the vault's 2026-04-10 backup commit): Ctrl+M move,
  Ctrl+D delete file, Alt+N / Alt+Shift+N new file, Alt+D new folder, Alt+C / Alt+B
  sidebars, Ctrl+\ / Ctrl+Shift+F6 splits. On 2026-10-02 only `<Space>m` was
  brought back.
- Centered scrolling (`nnoremap n nzz` etc.) is the one deliberate difference from nvim,
  which doesn't center. It must be `nnoremap`: the engine's keyToKey recursion guard
  (`vim.js` `doKeyToKey`) drops a mapping's own key, so `nmap n nzz` would only do `zz`.
- Ex aliases work because `matchCommand_` looks up the exact typed name first, so `:q`
  isn't shadowed by `:quickswitch`. Only `:w` (and `:image`) existed before.
- Ideas taken from a popular community vimrc: ex aliases, gf/go, blockquote toggle, a
  checkbox key. Skipped: the parts needing Pane Relief / VimEx / obsidian-zoom / Stille /
  JS commands, and `[`/`]` → `{`/`}`, which would break `[b`, `[h` and `[[`.
- Alternative not taken (for now): editing the vault from nvim with
  [obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim), the maintained fork.
