# System-wide Keybinds Reference

A single searchable index of every keybind on this machine — both window managers
(Hyprland and Mango, used interchangeably — check which one you're actually running),
Vim, and Neovim. Pulled directly from the live config files as of 2026-09-14, not from
the narrative decision-log entries elsewhere in this repo (those explain *why*; this is
just *what*).

**Keep this in sync**: whenever a keybind changes anywhere on this system, update the
matching row here too, in the same session.

Sources:
- Hyprland: `~/.config/hypr/config/binds.lua`
- Mango: `~/.config/mango/cfg/keybinds.conf`
- Vim: `~/.vimrc`
- Neovim: `~/.config/nvim/lua/config/keymaps.lua`, `lua/lsp.lua`, `after/plugin/telescope.lua`, `after/plugin/neotree.lua`
